## What is IaC?
IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes. Instead of physically configuring servers or using point-and-click interfaces, IaC uses configuration files that define the desired state of your infrastructure. These files are then used by tools to automatically create and manage your infrastructure resources.

## Why use IaC?
There are several advantages to using IaC:

- Automation: IaC automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure, saving time and reducing errors.
- Repeatability: IaC ensures that you can create identical infrastructure environments every time you deploy your application.
- Version control: IaC configuration files can be stored in version control systems, allowing you to track changes, rollback deployments, and collaborate with others.
- Consistency: IaC helps to ensure that your infrastructure is configured consistently across different environments.

## When to use IaC?
IaC is a good option for any organization that wants to automate the management of their infrastructure. It is particularly well-suited for organizations that:

- Deploy applications frequently
- Use cloud computing platforms
- Have a large and complex infrastructure
- For any repetetive tasks the we have to run

## Where to use IaC?
IaC can be used to provision and manage a wide range of infrastructure resources, including:

- Virtual machines
- Networks
- Storage
- Security groups
- Databases
- Load balancers

## IaC Tools:
There are several popular tools available for IaC, including:

- Terraform: A popular open-source tool that supports a wide range of cloud platforms and on-premises infrastructure.
- Ansible: An open-source tool that can be used for configuration management, application deployment, and IaC.
- AWS CloudFormation: A proprietary tool from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that can be used to provision and manage AWS resources.
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM): A proprietary tool from Microsoft Azure that can be used to provision and manage Azure resources.
- Puppet: 
- Chef: similar to Ansible for Configuration Management.

### Deeper dive into tooling:
1. Terraform:

- Focus: Open-source tool specifically designed for Infrastructure as Code.

*Strengths:*

- Multi-cloud and on-prem support: Provisions infrastructure across various cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP etc.) and on-premises infrastructure.
- Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL): Uses HCL, a declarative language specifically designed for IaC, making code easier to read and write.
- State management: Manages the state of your infrastructure (what resources exist) and ensures deployments are idempotent (can be run multiple times without unintended changes).
- Modules: Encourages code reusability through modular configuration files.

*Weaknesses:*

- Steeper learning curve: HCL might require some additional learning compared to simpler languages used by other tools.

2. Ansible:

- Focus: Open-source tool with broader functionality encompassing configuration management, application deployment, and IaC.

*Strengths:*

- Simple and agentless: Uses a human-readable YAML or JSON language and doesn't require software installation on managed machines.
- Powerful modules: Offers a vast library of modules for managing various configurations and resources.
- Flexibility: Can be used for more than just IaC, making it a versatile tool.

*Weaknesses:*

- State management is separate: Requires additional configuration for state management compared to Terraform's built-in solution.
- Security considerations: As it's agentless, security needs careful attention when managing remote systems.

3. AWS CloudFormation:

- Focus: Proprietary tool specifically designed to manage infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

*Strengths:*

- Native integration with AWS: Seamless integration with all AWS services for easy resource provisioning and management.
- Cost estimates: Provides cost estimates during infrastructure creation.
- AWS CloudFormation StackSets: Allows managing infrastructure across multiple AWS accounts and regions.

*Weaknesses:*

- Vendor lock-in: Limits you to the AWS cloud platform.
- Less flexible language: Uses JSON or YAML templates, which can be less expressive compared to HCL.

4. Azure Resource Manager (ARM):

- Focus: Proprietary tool for managing infrastructure on Microsoft Azure.

*Strengths:*

- Native integration with Azure: Seamless experience for provisioning and managing Azure resources.
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates: Uses JSON or YAML templates for defining infrastructure.
- Deployment options: Supports various deployment options like ARM templates, Bicep (a DSL for ARM templates), and Azure portal.

*Weaknesses:*

- Vendor lock-in: Limits you to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.
- Similar limitations to CloudFormation with regards to template language and flexibility.

### Choosing the right tool depends on your specific needs. Here's a quick guideline:

- If you need a multi-cloud or on-premises IaC solution with strong state management, Terraform is a good choice.
- If you prefer a simple and agentless tool for IaC or broader configuration management tasks, Ansible can be a great fit.
- If you're heavily invested in AWS and want a native solution, AWS CloudFormation is a strong contender.
- If you're working primarily on Microsoft Azure, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the natural choice.

## Ansible and its Benefits:
Ansible is a popular open-source tool that can be used for configuration management, application deployment, and IaC. Ansible uses a simple, human-readable language and is agentless, meaning it doesn't require any software to be installed on the machines it manages.

Here are some of the benefits of using Ansible for IaC:

- Simple and easy to learn: Ansible uses a YAML-based language that is easy to read and write, even for those without a programming background.
- Agentless: Ansible doesn't require any software to be installed on the machines it manages, which can simplify deployment and management.
- Powerful: Ansible can be used to manage a wide range of infrastructure resources and can also be used to deploy applications.

## Who's using IaC and Ansible?
IaC and Ansible are used by a wide range of organizations in all industries. Some of the companies that are known to use IaC and Ansible include:

- Netflix
- Uber
- Spotify
- Facebook
- Goldman Sachs

IaC and Ansible are becoming increasingly popular tools for automating the management of infrastructure. If you're looking for a way to improve the efficiency and reliability of your infrastructure management, then IaC and Ansible are definitely worth considering.
